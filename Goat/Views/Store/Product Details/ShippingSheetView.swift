            PURCHASES AND RETURNS
             
             This Purchases and Returns Policy is effective from December 16, 2020. You can view the prior Purchases and Returns Policy here.

             Effective Date: December 16, 2020

             PURCHASES

             CURRENCY

             All fees are listed in US dollars, unless otherwise stated. We are not responsible for currency exchange rates, except as described below. If you are an international buyer, you may have the option to buy items in your local currency or US dollars. If you opt to pay in your local currency:

             We'll automatically display your order total in your local currency on the checkout page. Your order total includes the foreign exchange rate as well as any applicable fees or costs.

             If you return a purchase that was purchased in your local currency, you will receive GOAT Credit in the amount you paid in your local currency converted to USD.

             Offers can only be made in USD at this time. We may display approximate conversions to help you make the best offer.

             Selling is only available in USD at the time.

             Some payment methods may not be supported.

             Because foreign exchange rates fluctuate, the price you see for an item in your local currency on one day may be different from the price for that same item on another day. The foreign exchange rates we apply are updated daily. GOAT takes no responsibility for the accuracy of any foreign exchange rate applied to your purchase or return.

             PRICING, AVAILABILITY AND SALES TAXES AND DUTIES

             All prices are subject to change without notice at any time. Available inventory is subject to change without notice at any time. As a result, if your order is canceled for any reason, you may not be able to purchase the same item you originally ordered, and if the same item is available, it may not be available at the same price of your original purchase.

             We will collect sales or use tax (collectively “Sales Tax”) on purchases of taxable items from buyers located in certain states where we have determined that we have a legal obligation to collect Sales Tax for such purchases. In these states, we will remit the tax collected from buyers to the appropriate taxing authority. In states where we do not collect Sales Tax, applicable state and local tax laws may require sellers or buyers to collect, remit, or pay Sales Tax to the appropriate taxing authority.

             Sales Tax will apply based on a buyer’s shipping address rather than a buyer’s billing address. Sales Tax will apply to all purchases of taxable items for applicable states, even for current offers that are completed at a later time.

             Applicable Sales Tax rates may vary by state. Note that some states may include shipping fees in the calculation of Sales Tax while other states may exclude shipping fees.

             To help provide a total cost inclusive of tax, we will estimate the applicable Sales Tax based on the delivery address entered at checkout. The estimated tax amount displayed may be updated when your order is finalized and completed.

             AUSTRALIA

             We are required to collect and remit a 10% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on certain orders that are shipped to an address located in Australia where the total value of the order (including shipping costs) is less than or equal to $1,000 AUD. Please note that additional duties and taxes may be collected at time of delivery.

             CHINA

             If you entered your People's Republic of China ID number at checkout then you will be charged a cross-border e-commerce tax in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This tax is meant to represent all applicable customs duties and taxes and no additional charges should be incurred upon your receipt of the item(s). If you do not enter this information at checkout, you will be liable for any applicable customs duties and/or taxes charged by the carrier upon receipt of your item(s). If you believe you have inadvertently been charged this tax, please reach out to support.cn@goat.com.

             NEW ZEALAND

             We are required to collect and remit a 15% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on certain orders that are shipped to an address located in New Zealand and the total value of the order (not including shipping costs) is less than or equal to $1,000 NZD. Please note that additional duties and taxes may be collected at the time of delivery.

             SAUDI ARABIA

             We currently ship DDU (delivered duties unpaid) to Saudi Arabia, so if you place an order for delivery in Saudi Arabia, you will be responsible for paying applicable VAT and duty charges on your order’s arrival in Saudi Arabia along with any other applicable fees.

             To provide you with additional information on such VAT and duty charges, your order confirmation email will show you the estimated VAT and duty charges for your order that you may be responsible for upon delivery. These estimated VAT and duty charges are based on the VAT and duty rates set by Saudi Arabia, but note that these are just estimated amounts and the final amounts may vary (for example, Saudi Arabia’s customs regulations and VAT and duty rates may change between the date the VAT and duty charges for your order are estimated and the date your order is imported into Saudi Arabia).

             We currently estimate VAT and duty charges as follows:

             VAT = VAT Rate x [Item Price + Insurance Cost (if any) + Shipping Costs + Duty (if any) + Other Applicable Taxes (if any)]
             Duty = Duty Rate x [Item Price + Insurance Cost (if any) + Shipping Costs]

             Our estimates of VAT and duty charges are based on the following facts and assumptions, which may change in the future:

             There will be no duty charge if the sum of the Item Price + Insurance Cost (if any) + Shipping Costs is less than 1000 SAR.

             The VAT Rate is 15%.

             The Duty Rate is 10%.

             Shipping Costs are $40 USD.

             There are no Insurance Costs or Other Applicable Taxes.

             You may also encounter a shipment disbursement fee. If the Item Price + Insurance Cost (if any) + Shipping Costs is less than 1000 SAR, this shipment disbursement fee will be 15 SAR. If the Item Price + Insurance Cost (if any) + Shipping Costs is 1000 SAR or more, this shipment disbursement fee will be equal to the greater of 100 SAR or 2% of the duties and taxes for the shipment.
             NORWAY

             If an order is shipped to an address located in Norway and the total value of the order (not including shipping costs) is less than or equal to NOK 3,000, we are required to collect and remit a 25% Value-Added Tax (VAT) on such order. The basis for calculating the 25% VAT includes the item price, the insurance cost (if any), the cost of packaging, and shipping costs.

             If an order is shipped to an address located in Norway and the total value of the order (not including shipping costs) is greater than NOK 3,000, VAT and duties may be collected at the Norway border.

             UNITED KINGDOM [Updated 1/11/2021]

             If an order is shipped to an address located in the United Kingdom and the total value of the order (not including shipping costs) is less than or equal to 135 GBP, we are required to collect and remit a 20% Value-Added Tax (VAT) on such order. The basis for calculating the 20% VAT includes the item price, the insurance cost (if any), the cost of packaging, and shipping costs.

             If an order is shipped to an address located in the United Kingdom and the total value of the order (not including shipping costs) is greater than 135 GBP, VAT and duties may be collected at the border.

             See our FAQ for more details regarding our collection of Sales Taxes and Duties.

             For international buyers: we will declare the price that was paid for customs purposes. Buyers are responsible for the applicable customs duties and taxes that are billed by their respective countries of residence.

             PAYMENT METHODS

             We accept several methods of payments. If you purchase items in the United States, we accept American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard and Visa. Alternate methods of payment include Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Affirm (US only), Afterpay (US only), and Alipay.

             SHIPPING, CONTACT, BILLING AND PAYMENT INFORMATION

             Please review your shipping, contact, billing and payment information for accuracy before submitting an order. Billing information must match the billing information you have on file with the issuing bank.

             Please note that GOAT is unable to change a shipping address once the order has been placed. For sneakers, you may be able to cancel your order (within 3 hours of placing it and/or before it is confirmed by the seller, whichever comes first), and place the order again with the correct shipping address.

             SHIPPING

             The cost of US domestic shipping (for items other than “Instant” items ordered with Next Day shipping) is $12 to the 48 contiguous states and $15 to Hawaii and Alaska.

             The cost of shipping for “Instant” items ordered with Next Day shipping is $25. Please note, Next Day shipping is only available for “Instant” items with a delivery address within the 48 contiguous states and is not available for orders to be delivered to PO Boxes or military bases.

             “Instant” items also incur a 6.5% priority processing fee.

             The cost of shipping for items to be delivered to an address in the People’s Republic of China is $25.

             For a limited time, the cost of shipping for items to be delivered to an address in Canada is $30 and $40 to all other international countries other than the People’s Republic of China.

             Customers may incur additional charges for purchases of multiple items or heavy items.

             Items except for “Instant” items are shipped to us first for authentication and verification before being delivered to you. It will typically take 7-10 business days (M-F) for sneaker orders to be delivered to a buyer located in the US, since it takes approximately 3-4 business days to get to us, 1-2 business days to authenticate and 3-4 business days to ship to you.

             Items that are labeled “Instant” have already been authenticated and verified and ship directly from our facilities to you. Excluding deliveries to PO boxes and military bases, it will typically take 3-4 business days for an “Instant” item ordered before 11:00 am PT with standard shipping to be delivered to a buyer located in the 48 contiguous states and 4-5 business days for an “Instant” item ordered after 11:00 am PT with standard shipping to be delivered to a buyer located in the 48 contiguous states.

             Next Day shipping is a shipping option for “Instant” items that is available only to buyers located in the 48 contiguous states, excluding PO boxes and military bases. It will typically take 1 business day for an “Instant” item ordered before 11:00 am PT with Next Day shipping to be delivered to a buyer located in the 48 contiguous states and 2 business days for an “Instant” item ordered after 11:00 am PT with Next Day shipping to be delivered to a buyer located in the 48 contiguous states.

             Some apparel and accessory items have been pre-verified and authenticated and ship directly from our trusted retail and boutique partners, while other apparel and accessory items are shipped to us first for authentication and verification before being delivered to you. It will typically take 4-8 business days for an apparel or accessory item order to be delivered to a buyer located in the US.

             For international orders, delivery times vary due to customs. For items with a delivery address in the People’s Republic of China, import duties will be included at checkout for buyers who enter their national identification number and the items will be delivered duty paid (i.e., no additional duties should be required to be paid upon delivery). For all other international orders and for items with a delivery address in the People’s Republic of China where a buyer does not enter their national identification number, import duties are not included, and you will be responsible for them upon arrival.

             Delivery times are estimates and are not guaranteed, as shipments may be affected by weather-related delays or events outside of our control.

             If your order is returned to us as undeliverable, your item(s) will be placed into GOAT Storage under your account. Please see “GOAT Storage” below for information on how to retrieve items from GOAT Storage.

             ORDER REVIEW

             All orders are subject to fraud review which may result in a delay in processing. We may also require additional information in order to verify your purchase. Until you receive final confirmation of your purchase, please check your email and respond to any requests for verification. While your order is being reviewed, your account may be placed on hold until the review is completed.

             ORDER CANCELLATION

             We reserve the right to cancel orders in our sole discretion.

             For sneakers, you may cancel your order within 3 hours of placing it or before it is confirmed by the seller - whichever comes first. If 3 hours have passed from when you placed the order and/or the seller has confirmed the order, then the order cannot be canceled. If neither have occurred, simply tap the Cancel button on the Orders screen.

             For apparel and accessories that have been pre-verified and authenticated and ship directly from our trusted retail and boutique partners, all orders are auto-confirmed and cannot be canceled. For other apparel and accessories, you may cancel your order within 3 hours of placing it or before it is confirmed by the seller – whichever comes first – as described in the previous paragraph. Your order confirmation message in the GOAT app will let you know whether your order can be canceled.

             You may not cancel an offer after the offer has been accepted by a seller.

             If an order is canceled before you have been charged for the order, you may see a pending authorization on your card that will fall off of your account in a few days but you will not be charged for the order. If an order is canceled after you have been charged for the order, we will refund you the amount you paid for the item(s) to your original method of payment. Please allow 7 to 10 business days for the refund to be reflected on your next billing cycle.

             RETURNS

             We want you to be happy with your purchase, which is why we accept returns on New In Box, New No Box, GOAT Clean, apparel purchases, and accessory purchases that are in the same condition as when shipped and that do not fall within any of the categories described in the next sentence. We do not issue refunds or accept returns or exchanges on any items listed as "Final Sale" on the checkout page, special items (e.g., Vintage, Sample, ID, Custom, Defect, Pre-Release), any used items, any GOAT Storage items, or any items shipped to a freight forwarder or a delivery address in the People's Republic of China. All purchases of such items are FINAL SALE and we do not issue refunds or accept returns for such purchases.

             You have 3 days to request a return from the date you received the item(s). To initiate a return, tap “Request Return” in the GOAT app when you receive your package or contact us here. Once we receive your return, the item(s) will be evaluated before your refund is made. Evaluation criteria include the following:

             Item(s) must include the return label and packing slip provided by us—Please note: Returns will not be processed without a GOAT return label and packing slip.

             Item(s) must be in the condition they were in when sent by us, including but not limited to: no damage, original tags, no creases as a result of try-on and/or wear, no sole wear or debris (for sneaker items), and all original packaging included.

             Item(s) must be shipped to us within 3 days from receiving your Return Label. The evaluation process may take up to 7 days from receipt of return request and we reserve the right to make the final decision on all return requests.

             Once we process your return, we will refund you for the amount you paid for the item(s), less the shipping costs to and from you and less any priority processing fee paid, by issuing you site credit (GOAT credit) to use on future purchases, except as otherwise determined by us in our sole and reasonable discretion.

             Make sure to only include the item(s) to be returned in your shipping box.

             If your return request is not approved by us for any reason, we will notify you of our decision via email. For sneaker item(s), you will have the option to have the item(s) sent back to you at your expense or consigned on your behalf with us. For apparel and accessory item(s), you may have the item(s) sent back to you at your expense. If you elect to have item(s) sent back to you, we will send you an invoice for the shipping costs and send the item(s) to you after you have paid for the return shipping costs. If you choose to consign sneaker item(s), we will activate the listing(s) at the same price you paid for such sneaker item(s) and if the sneaker item(s) are sold, you will be paid pursuant to our Fee Policy. You may change the listing price at any time within the GOAT app.

             For sneaker item(s), if you do not respond within 14 days of receiving notice that your return request was not approved or if you do not pay the shipping invoice within 14 days of receipt, we will consign the sneaker item(s) on your behalf and activate the listing(s) at the same price you paid for such sneaker item(s) and if the sneaker item(s) are sold, you will be paid pursuant to our Fee Policy. You may change the listing price at any time within the GOAT app.

             If your return request is not approved by us because the item(s) were inauthentic, you will have the option to have the item(s) sent back to you or disposed of by us in our reasonable discretion. If you choose to have the item(s) sent back to you, we will send you an invoice for the shipping costs back to you. If you do not respond within 14 days of receiving notice that your return request was not approved or if you do not pay the shipping invoice within 14 days of receipt, we will dispose of the item(s) in our reasonable discretion.

             If you consign item(s) with us as described above, the terms and conditions under “Consigned Items” in the Selling on GOAT Policy will apply to your consignment of such item(s) with us.

             DISPUTES

             If for any reason, you dispute any transaction made on the GOAT app or website, your account may be placed on hold until the dispute is resolved. You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regard to item(s) you purchase on the GOAT app or website. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as provided under “Returns” above, you will not dispute or seek a chargeback from the company whose credit card or method of payment you used to purchase item(s) on the GOAT app or website. Should you do so, your order(s) may be canceled, and we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all persons in whose name(s) the credit accounts exist and any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from purchasing item(s) on the GOAT app or website.

             GOAT CLEAN

             All items listed here and in the GOAT Clean section of the used section of a given item are part of the GOAT Clean collection. Each item listed has been professionally cleaned, graded and photographed to provide full transparency on the condition of the item.

             To provide buyers comfort around the quality of items being purchased, we developed a proprietary grading system for GOAT Clean items. Once an item goes through the GOAT Clean process, we assess the condition of the item inside and out. We score each part of the item and ultimately assign a grade that communicates the overall condition of such item.

             Like New: Minimal to no signs of wear.

             Excellent: Slight wear on tread with minimal creasing.

             Very Good: Gentle wear with some creasing, scratches, and/or slight discoloration.

             Good: Moderate wear with visible creasing, scuffing, and/or discoloration.

             We believe in providing complete transparency - that what you see in photos, is what you get. This is why we offer returns on all GOAT Clean purchases. You have 3 days to request a return from the date you receive your GOAT Clean purchases. Once we process your return, we will refund you for the amount you paid, less the shipping costs to and from you. This refund will be issued in the form of GOAT credit to use on future purchases.

             GOAT STORAGE
